                <h1>Where It All Began</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The story began in the Caribbean Sea with a vacation gone awry. Upon leaving his valuables on the
                    beach unattended, Don Halpern became the latest unfortunate victim of daylight robbery. Having been
                    stripped of nearly all his worldly possessions, Don began his search for a theft proof bag. After
                    fruitlessly scouring the internet for a quality solution, Don happened upon a novel and innovative
                    idea - a lockable backpack that would be both stylish and technically outstanding. Thus, the
                    LOCTOTE® was born.</p>

                        <p>Our first LOCTOTE® was launched on Kickstarter in 2016. We became, at that time, the highest
                            grossing backpack ever in the history of Kickstarter. From there, we were invited onto ABC's
                            hit series, Shark Tank, where we made a sweet deal. Through it all, we have never strayed
                            from our core focus of providing a means for the everyday explorer to live more and worry
                            less.</p>
